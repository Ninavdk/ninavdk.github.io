<p>I am driven by a desire to learn.</p>
<p>I have some inspiration to meet a real world need through provision of a product/service. I don't know what the end goal even looks like, but I figure it can't hurt to test some ideas out and give it a try.</p>
<p>So I'm planning to go through the process of conceiving an idea, testing if it has merit in meeting a need and if so, attempting to deliver something to an end user.</p>
<p>I plan to document the experience as I go, in the hope to show what is learnt.</p>

<p>edit: lesson learnt - include blog date and title in file name to make it work with <a src="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Also include .md filetype extension</p>
