<p>If you’re reading this post any time recently after it was published, the site is going to look pretty bare bones. Maybe it always will be, who knows?!</p>
<p>I made a decision in setting this site up that I wanted to do everything from scratch. It’s driven by my desire learn stuff in general, but also to specifically understand how a website is put together, from the ground up. I work in websites and spend loads of my time every working day dealing with components. But I’ve never truly understood how it all fits together at a technical level.</p>
<p>In setting up this site up I’ve learnt HEAPS already. I’m managing the setup like a project using GitHub. I’ve got big plans/dreams and so far it’s still really fun tinkering away.</p>
<p>Also, in conjunction I’m doing a comprehensive web 101 course by freeCodeCamp. Checkout my first challenge - a <a href="https://codepen.io/ninavdk/pen/KgqWBN">tribute to blankets</a> :) </p>
