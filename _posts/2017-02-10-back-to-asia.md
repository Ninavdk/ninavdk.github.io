Last weekend I boarded a plane and took the next big step in this adventure we call life, to make a start trying to live a different lifestyle - Coworking in Indonesia.

This is a plan my partner and I have been working towards for over a year. Although in actuality this is something I've wanted to do for what feels like forever.

Week one has been an up and down affair. Unfortunately I had to go alone as my partner was held up for some last minute necessary work in Australia, so I've been lone ranger-ing it. I've had quite a bit of work stress, which - even with a great backdrop, is still tough to handle.

It's an interesting phenomenon - being back in Asia. ~10 years ago I spent 6 months living in Vietnam, and I've also quite extensively travelled throughout the region, particularly South East Asia. I am both comforted by how confident and familiar the place is, but also somehow disheartened.  

In my efforts to make this blog/site more profesh I went and bought a domain and [associated it to this site](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/#configuring-an-alias-or-aname-record-with-your-dns-provider "configuring-an-alias-or-aname-record-with-your-dns-provider").  It’s working now - [ninavdk.com]() is live, Yay!

#### Lessons learnt
- Don’t be relaxed about information you put online - anywhere, ever.
- If you're using Jekyll you can use Markdown you don't need to code it all in HTML!
- How to [preview markdown](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) easily in Atom
