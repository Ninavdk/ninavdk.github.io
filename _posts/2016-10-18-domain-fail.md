title: "Domain Fail"

In my efforts to make this blog/site more profesh I went and bought a domain and [associated it to this site](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/#configuring-an-alias-or-aname-record-with-your-dns-provider "configuring-an-alias-or-aname-record-with-your-dns-provider").  It’s working now - [ninavdk.com]() is live, Yay!

It’s was all pretty easy to setup with Github pages just using their admin panel settings. However in the process of doing this all I made a MASSIVE FAIL.

When buying my domain, I was feeling thrifty, so I opted _not_ to buy the add on “make my info private” option. Instead I just popped in my deets, clicked through and finished the the transaction. I knew it got added to a directory listing somewhere but I honestly (and naively) thought no one would really go and look at it and be interested in it. And I guess I was feeling a bit cheap. Mistake...

First I got a flood of emails and calls from enterprising web design agencies across the globe calling me to offer their services for my domain. While a bit annoying, this was no real biggy to me. I can appreciate businesses trying to generate leads. I’d never thought of this as an avenue, but it’s a pretty smart channel to source from.

I only really started to realize how much I'd screwed up when I got a text from my bank to say my card had been put on hold cause of suspicious transactions. Thank god for bank fraud security measures. It turns out in the middle of the night my card had been used for a series of small transactions, totaling up to over a hundred bucks. This looked pretty suss so the bank froze it all and notified me. I’d been hacked somehow.

I can't confirm it for sure, but I have a big hunch that it's related to my whimsical choice to put a bunch of my personal info out on public record for anyone to come along and scoop up.

It was annoying when the agencies called me, but I can live with that. Realizing the potential identity theft that I’d open myself up to - that scared the shit out of me.

I’ve gone and removed all the private info I can against the registry, but it’s like trying to capture a bull once it’s out of the gate. No chance, this is the internet people. The best I think I can from here is take the lesson to be way more diligent with personal details online from now on, sad panda.

So an actual serious life lesson learnt. You can never be overcautious online. Like, everywhere. Watch what you're doing people. Nothing is private!

#### Lessons learnt
- Don’t be relaxed about information you put online - anywhere, ever.
- If you're using Jekyll you can use Markdown you don't need to code it all in HTML!
- How to [preview markdown](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) easily in Atom
