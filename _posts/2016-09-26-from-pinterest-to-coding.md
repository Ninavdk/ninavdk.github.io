<p>Over the past few days I've been tapping into the wealth of resources available on the net to setup this personal site. Namely <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, <a href="https://freecodecamp.com">freeCodeCamp</a> and a very helpful blog post by
    <a href="http://jmcglone.com/">jmcglone</a> on how to <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">setup a website using GitHub pages</a>.</p>

<p>But when I think back to how I stumbled upon these resources, and what lead me to embark on this site/project, it’s a less auspicious origin than you’d expect: <a href="https://au.pinterest.com/ninavdk99/"> Pinterest</a>.</p>

<p>Whatttt?</p>

<p>Yep. I was ratting around, setting up a vision board to inspire me to continue to slog through my day job (a topic for another time). Whilst pinning some dream pics about <a href="https://au.pinterest.com/ninavdk99/bali/">Ubud, Bali</a> and remote working, the search suggested me some <a href="https://au.pinterest.com/ninavdk99/code/">coding pic/pins</a>. Which lead me to gitHub (a cloud based version control collaboration hub). Which in turn lead me onto a wealth of documentation and real world examples which were easy enough to follow that I thought, ‘shit I could actually give this a go’.</p>

    <li>#4 You can setup your own repository collection, run wiki’s, use board based project management and run static webpages using Github, all for FREE</li>
